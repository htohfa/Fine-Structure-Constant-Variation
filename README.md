# Runaway-Dilaton-Alpha-Variation
The purpose of this program is to read dynamic equations of fine structure constant variation and finding best fit for parameter values. We 
write the dynamics equation as a function of our free parameters. Then, we first evaluate the dynamic equation numerically, then calculate the
projection of the fundamental constant eigenmodes onto the given model. We then calculate Chi-squared value for corresponding model using 
generalized projection from fundamental constant variation as data. We then minimize the chi-squared value using ensemble sampler and run MCMC
to constrain all of our parameters
